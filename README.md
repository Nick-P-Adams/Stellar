# Stellar
## Description
Game about a rouge star that is consuming it's stellar neighbors. Consume the mass of smaller stellar objects or be consumed by larger ones. This is a game jam project that I am pretty proud of. It was not finished during the first game jam I worked on it. There is no real "game" elements add to it yet but the overall structure of the game is in place. `Dallas Society of Play` has a game jam on `Oct 13th 2022` called `Revival Jam II` where we finish old projects that have been on the back burner. I plan on making more progress on this project then.
